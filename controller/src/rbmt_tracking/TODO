tracking goals:
- predict hit point of shuttle cock

===
to do list:
1. collect training data
	1.1 Collect input data: Wi = {x,y,z,color}
		1.1.1 Robust centroid detection: using color, minimum number of points
	1.2 Collect output data: Yi = {x,y,z,color}
		1.2.1 With ps3 eye detect cock drop point at the floor
	1.3 Integration input and output collection

2. training the predictor
	2.1 Design feature vector
	2.2 Split data to training and testing data
	2.3 Tune and train SVR (Support Vector Regression) -- (Scikit-learn.org)
	2.4 Evaluate the regression model
	2.5 Re-iterate: try gaussion process regressor, neural network, etc
