Note

From http://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Exporting-to-GCC-ARM-Embedded:
GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors is one of the external offline toolchains supported by the mbed platform.
Whilst we support exporting your project and the libraries to an alternate toolchain, 
we cannot guarantee the same consistency as using the mbed Online Compiler.
